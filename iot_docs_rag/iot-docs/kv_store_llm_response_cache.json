On this page we summarize the main limitations of the\n\nindividual versions, particularly the **C-Xatlas** version. It is always possible to upgrade to a higher version.\n\n**The basic version, C-Xatlas**, is particularly suitable for monitoring operation and collecting data from a fleet of devices and then sending it\nto time and attendance software. It also offers some access control functionality for simple plants. Among the various limitations detailed in\n\nthe table on the next page, we highlight in particular that **C-Xatlas** does not allow plant control on interactive synoptic, nor integration with\n\nvideo surveillance.\n\n**Multi-gate terminals** : most Axess TMC terminals and controllers can control multiple gates (X3 for example manages up to 8). To accomplish\n\nthis, the equipment of readers and I/O is expanded through FD devices connected on the RS485 port. Each reader, input or output is\nassigned to a specific gateway. This functionality is fully exploited by **D-Xatlas** and **E-Xatlas**, whereas these terminals, when managed by\n\n**C-Xatlas**, are limited to manage only one gate. Therefore, **C-Xatlas** requires a terminal or controller for each gate even though the terminals\n\nor controllers would potentially be able to control more than one.\n\nThe **D-Xatlas** and **E-Xatlas** versions can replicate their databases on FMs and XPoints ensuring the operation of the system or part of it\n\neven in the event of central server failure (Server independent). FMs and XPoints are also required in the case of plants spanning multiple\n\ntime zones. Installations managed by **C-Xatlas** must all be within the same time zone.\n\nFor particularly critical installations, the **E-Xatlas** version also has the ability to work with multiple databases with load balancing capabilities\n\nto handle even very high demand loads without performance degradation.\n\n\n134\n\n**Contemporary operators** 25 100 100 each node\n\n\n135\n\n### C-Xatlas\n\nSoftware for monitoring terminals or integrated management of basic access control systems.

On this page we summarize the main limitations of the\\n\\nindividual versions, particularly the **C-Xatlas** version. It is always possible to upgrade to a higher version.\\n\\n**The basic version, C-Xatlas**, is particularly suitable for monitoring operation and collecting data from a fleet of devices and then sending it\\nto time and attendance software. It also offers some access control functionality for simple plants. Among the various limitations detailed in\\n\\nthe table on the next page, we highlight in particular that **C-Xatlas** does not allow plant control on interactive synoptic, nor integration with\\n\\nvideo surveillance.\\n\\n**Multi-gate terminals** : most Axess TMC terminals and controllers can control multiple gates (X3 for example manages up to 8). To accomplish\\n\\nthis, the equipment of readers and I/O is expanded through FD devices connected on the RS485 port. Each reader, input or output is\\nassigned to a specific gateway. This functionality is fully exploited by **D-Xatlas** and **E-Xatlas**, whereas these terminals, when managed by\\n\\n**C-Xatlas**, are limited to manage only one gate. Therefore, **C-Xatlas** requires a terminal or controller for each gate even though the terminals\\n\\nor controllers would potentially be able to control more than one.\\n\\nThe **D-Xatlas** and **E-Xatlas** versions can replicate their databases on FMs and XPoints ensuring the operation of the system or part of it\\n\\neven in the event of central server failure (Server independent). FMs and XPoints are also required in the case of plants spanning multiple\\n\\ntime zones. Installations managed by **C-Xatlas** must all be within the same time zone.\\n\\nFor particularly critical installations, the **E-Xatlas** version also has the ability to work with multiple databases with load balancing capabilities\\n\\nto handle even very high demand loads without performance degradation.\\n\\n\\n134\\n\\n**Contemporary operators** 25 100 100 each node\\n\\n\\n135\\n\\n### C-Xatlas\\n\\nSoftware for monitoring terminals or integrated management of basic access control systems.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n---Output---\n\nAdd them below using the same format:"
