On this page we summarize the main limitations of the\n\nindividual versions, particularly the **C-Xatlas** version. It is always possible to upgrade to a higher version.\n\n**The basic version, C-Xatlas**, is particularly suitable for monitoring operation and collecting data from a fleet of devices and then sending it\nto time and attendance software. It also offers some access control functionality for simple plants. Among the various limitations detailed in\n\nthe table on the next page, we highlight in particular that **C-Xatlas** does not allow plant control on interactive synoptic, nor integration with\n\nvideo surveillance.\n\n**Multi-gate terminals** : most Axess TMC terminals and controllers can control multiple gates (X3 for example manages up to 8). To accomplish\n\nthis, the equipment of readers and I/O is expanded through FD devices connected on the RS485 port. Each reader, input or output is\nassigned to a specific gateway. This functionality is fully exploited by **D-Xatlas** and **E-Xatlas**, whereas these terminals, when managed by\n\n**C-Xatlas**, are limited to manage only one gate. Therefore, **C-Xatlas** requires a terminal or controller for each gate even though the terminals\n\nor controllers would potentially be able to control more than one.\n\nThe **D-Xatlas** and **E-Xatlas** versions can replicate their databases on FMs and XPoints ensuring the operation of the system or part of it\n\neven in the event of central server failure (Server independent). FMs and XPoints are also required in the case of plants spanning multiple\n\ntime zones. Installations managed by **C-Xatlas** must all be within the same time zone.\n\nFor particularly critical installations, the **E-Xatlas** version also has the ability to work with multiple databases with load balancing capabilities\n\nto handle even very high demand loads without performance degradation.\n\n\n134\n\n**Contemporary operators** 25 100 100 each node\n\n\n135\n\n### C-Xatlas\n\nSoftware for monitoring terminals or integrated management of basic access control systems.

They are divided into 3 categories:\n\n**•** **FIELD PROCESSOR** : (Only for D-XAtlas and E-XAtlas) they contain\na replica of the database and are able to function even if the server is\n\nunreachable. The 485 Field Devices (FD) connect to these devices. They\n\ncan be in DIN rail format (FM) or in terminal format with touch screen\n\ndisplay (XPoint) through which supervisors can access the system or can\nfunction as identification terminals.\n\n**•** **FIELD DEVICE (FD):** RS485 devices that control the physical elements\nof the system such as gates or alarms, or allow the user to identify\n\nthemselves. They are connected to FIELD PROCESSORS\n\n**•** **ETHERNET FIELD DEVICE (FE):** Same as FDs but the connection to their\n\ncontroller is via Ethernet connection\n\nIn addition to these, almost all the terminals and controllers present in the\nHardware section can also be managed by XAtlas to offer further functions in\nthe field.\n\n\n152\n\n***Field Processor***\n\n***Ethernet Field device (FE)***\n\n\n***Field device (FD) - Readers***\n\n153\n\n\n***Field device (FD)***\n\n##### Dimensioning Ethernet devices in the XAtlas system\n\nAs explained in detail in the section ‘Comparison of XAtlas Versions’, multigateterminals support only 1 slave gate/terminal when\n\nmanaged by the Xatlas-C version. Below are the values that can be used with Xatlas-D and Xatlas-E editions:\n\n**•** **X7, X4 GLASS, X4, XA4, XA4K X3, X3BIO** : multigate supports up to 8 gates and 8 slave devices\n\n**•** **XIO, i-door e i-door+** : manage up to 8 gates and 24 slave devices\n\nThe Field Manager (FM) page as well as the next page, shows the maximum number of terminals X* managed according to FM types (64\n\nin the case of FMV)\n\n**Maximum size of users/cards tables:** in addition to respecting the maximum number of terminals X* per type of Field Manager, must\n\nbe respected the recommended maximum size limit of the tables USERS.TXT and CARDS.TXT tables for X* terminal type. Exceeding the\n\nrecommended size, the plant may break down, for example concurrently with the resending of all the tables to all the terminals, e.g. after\nan Xatlas update or with a high number of daily modifications of the tables.\n\nIn Xatlas, in the “Advanced Configuration” panel of each X* terminal it is necessary to enable massive transmission, indexing and (where\n\npossible) the tables compression.\n\n**ATTENTION: Please note that USERS.TXT and CARDS.TXT tables of the X* terminals, contain the data of ALL users of the site to**\n\n**which they belong. Only biometric data are partitioned by authorisation.**\n\n\n154\n\nHere below, tables showing the capabilities of each Ethernet device when managed by Xatlas:\n\n\n\n\n**X3, X3BIO, X4, X7, XIO, i-door, i-door+ (*)** **5.000 users / cards**\n\n**NOTE (*)** : When using X3, X3BIO, X4, X7, XIO, i-door, i-door+, in case of higher numbers, please contact pre-sales\n\nsupport\n\n\n\n\n155\n\n##### XATLAS HARDWARE | FIELD MANAGER (FM)\n\nFIELD PROCESSOR fon DIN rail: Controller of D-Xatlas and E-Xatlas system\n\n**Server independent:** a copy of the Database is stored in this powerful controller that is\ntherefore able to keep managing its part of the plant (FD, FE ...) even in case the main XAtlas\nserver is no more online.\n\n**Simple replacement in case of failure:** FM memory is on a USB pendrive, therefore, in\ncase of failure, simply plug the pendrive into a new hardware to be up and running again.\n\n**2 RS485 networks:** 2 different RS485 lines for conneting Field Devices (FD)\n\n**Ethernet port 10/100/1000 Mbit/s** to communicate with Xatlas and other field processors\nin peer-to-peer mode (NO POE). **USB ports** compliant with USB 1.0 and USB 2.0.
